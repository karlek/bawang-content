# Book META

## Book META

To book META please use the booking system at 
**[bokning.datasektionen.se](http://bokning.datasektionen.se)**. If you
have any questions, please contact the chapter-house bosses by email,
**[lokalbokning@d.kth.se](mailto:lokalbokning@d.kth.se)**. The email
goes to both the representative from Computer Science but also the one
from Media (but CS will most likely reply to you). You need to be a
member of the chapter in order to book META. To get all the rules,
please ask in your email.
The top calendar is for all of META, the bottom one for the meetingroom.
Please specify which you want to book. When booking META, please specify
whether or not you are going to serve alcohol (not necessary if you only
book the meetingroom).

In this year's cohabitation agreements (2016) states (note: translated):
<br>
*More than three (3) repeated bookings for a time in the week may not
occur, this to avoid overbooking of the meeting room. Exceptions apply
to each sections board, which may have a recurrent time of the week.
Exceptions may also be granted by the local managers or issued in
conjunction with booking META*

This is interpreted as that you may not book a fourth time before the
first three bookings are used. Note that this only applies to bookings
at the same time (for example, Wednesday 10-12).
